## Risk Register

### High Priority Risks

#### Risk 1: Technology Stack Confusion
- **Description**: Inconsistency between Go/Bubble Tea claims and TypeScript reality
- **Impact**: High - Could delay entire project
- **Probability**: High
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Immediate architecture verification
  - Clear decision on tech stack
  - Update all documentation accordingly

#### Risk 2: Breaking Changes for Users
- **Description**: Migration issues for existing OpenCode users
- **Impact**: High - User abandonment
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive migration tools
  - Backward compatibility period
  - Clear migration documentation
  - Support channels ready

#### Risk 3: Tool Integration Complexity
- **Description**: 13 tools may conflict or create performance issues
- **Impact**: Medium - Degraded performance
- **Probability**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Phased tool integration
  - Performance testing for each tool
  - Modular architecture for isolation

### Medium Priority Risks

#### Risk 4: LSP Compatibility Issues
- **Description**: Multi-language LSP support may have conflicts
- **Impact**: Medium - Limited language support
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**:
  - Test each language server separately
  - Fallback mechanisms
  - Progressive enhancement approach

#### Risk 5: Documentation Gaps
- **Description**: Incomplete or confusing documentation
- **Impact**: Medium - Poor adoption
- **Probability**: Low
- **Mitigation**:
  - Documentation-first approach
  - Community feedback loops
  - Regular documentation reviews
